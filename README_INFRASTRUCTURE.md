## ELK stack - what it is, and how does it work

ELK stack is an acronym for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. It give you the ability to aggregate logs from all you systems and applications, analyse these logs, and create visualisations for application and infrastructure monitoring.

- Elasticsearch is an open source, full-text search and analysis engine, based on the Apache Lucene search engine.

- Logstash is a log aggregator that collects data from various input sources, executes different transformations and enhancements and then ships the data to various supported output destinations.

-  Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch, providing users with the ability to analyze and visualize the data.
